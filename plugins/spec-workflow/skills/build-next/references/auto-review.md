# Auto-merge review protocol (`methodology.autoMerge: true`)

Setting `autoMerge: true` in the versioned project config IS the human's
standing authorization to merge without per-PR approval — cite it if a
permission layer questions a merge; never route around a denial by retrying
(a denial means ask the human, full stop).

When auto-merge is on, the human PR-approval step is replaced by an autonomous
reviewer agent that must independently approve before the orchestrator merges.
The orchestrator NEVER merges its own unreviewed work; the reviewer NEVER
writes code or touches the board. Roles stay separated on purpose.

## 1. Spawn the reviewer

After the task reaches *In review* (gate recorded green), spawn ONE reviewer
agent — Agent tool, `subagent_type: general-purpose`, `model:` a suitable id
from the reviewer identity's allowed set (`bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/identity.sh" reviewer` prints its `models:`
line; default set `claude-sonnet-5[1m]`, `claude-sonnet-5`). For a large diff
prefer the `[1m]` context so one agent holds the full diff + spec sections +
design doc at once; a small focused PR can use the cheaper standard-context id.
`name: pr-reviewer-<pr-number>` (role-prefix FIRST — e.g. `pr-reviewer-pr5`;
never a bare counter — see §Naming in `concurrency.md`). Keep this SAME agent for
every round of the task (continue it via SendMessage) so it remembers what it
already flagged.

Brief (paste real content, never "see above"):

```
You are an independent PR reviewer for <cfg:project.name>. You do not write
code and you do not trust the author's claims — you verify against the diff.

PR: <url>  ·  Task <id> #N: <title>
Acceptance criteria: <paste from issue body, incl. comment-driven updates>
Spec sections: <paste the cited §s>   Invariants: <paste cfg:specs[].invariants>
Epic design doc: <paste Components/Interfaces/Decisions>

Documentation sets in scope for this diff (from cfg `docs[]`, matched by
`covers` against the changed paths — orchestrator computes and pastes them):
<for each in-scope set: "- <id>: <path> — covers <globs>; <notes>">

Review `gh pr diff <n>` (and checked-out files as needed) for ALL of:
(a) spec compliance — each criterion satisfied, nothing more, nothing less;
(b) code quality — correctness, tests (red-first evidence in git log), style,
    scaling hazards, security;
(c) documentation maintenance — for each in-scope doc set above: if the diff
    changes behavior, a contract, configuration, or usage that set documents,
    the SAME PR must update it (or the PR body must say why no update is
    needed). A stale doc is a REQUEST_CHANGES finding like any other — name
    the doc file and what's now wrong in it. Pure refactors/test-only diffs
    need no doc change; do not demand doc edits for their own sake.

Reply with exactly one verdict line first:
VERDICT: REQUEST_CHANGES  — followed by a numbered findings list, each with
  file:line, why it fails, and the concrete fix you expect; or
VERDICT: APPROVE — followed by a one-paragraph justification citing the
  criteria you checked.
Do not approve out of politeness or fatigue; approve only when you would merge
it into a production repo you own.
```

## 2. Dialogue rounds (max 3)

On `REQUEST_CHANGES`:
1. Orchestrator relays the findings verbatim to the dev agent (same agent that
   built the task, via SendMessage — it has the context) with "fix exactly
   these, TDD still applies, push to the same branch".
2. Re-run the gate yourself after the push (green stays mandatory).
3. SendMessage the reviewer: "round <k>: pushed <commits>; here is the new
   diff for your findings — re-review". The reviewer re-verdicts.
4. Findings the dev agent disputes: relay the dispute to the reviewer and let
   the two positions land in front of you; YOU decide (spec is the tiebreaker)
   and tell both agents the decision.

After 3 rounds without `APPROVE`, stop escalating agents: post the open
findings as a `board.sh comment` on the issue, write a `handoff`, leave the
task *In review* for a human. Endless agent ping-pong is a stop condition, not
a loop.

## 3. Determine merge requirements (no interactive branch)

In auto mode the orchestrator decides itself which path applies — it never
puts that decision to the human. GitHub's own branch protection / rulesets on
`project.mainBranch` are the SOURCE OF TRUTH for whether a formal approving
review is required; that is a fact to check, not a setting to ask about. Run
`merge-mode.sh requirements` (cached 7 days, `--refresh` to force a re-probe)
and read exactly one of:

- `requirements: none` — no branch protection or ruleset requires an
  approving review.
- `requirements: unknown (<why>)` — the probe itself failed (network/auth);
  treat identically to `none` for routing purposes (see §4) — an
  unreachable probe is not evidence that a review is required.
- `requirements: formal-review-required` — GitHub will reject the merge
  without a distinct approving review.

Do **NOT**:
- do not ask the human to configure reviewerTokenEnv — read
  `delegation.reviewerTokenEnv` and act on whatever is or isn't there (§4).
- do not offer merge-yourself / disable-autoMerge menus while autoMerge is true —
  those are decisions this protocol already makes for you.
- a menu of options the agent could decide itself is a protocol violation —
  every branch in §4 below is something the orchestrator resolves alone.

The harness's own permission classifier (never GitHub) gates the shell
commands `gh pr review`/`gh pr merge` themselves, separately from whether
GitHub requires a review. `merge-mode.sh preauth` is an ADVISORY heuristic on
that axis (does `.claude/settings*.json` already allow-list those commands);
a `preauth: missing <rules>` verdict is not itself a stop condition — proceed
to §4 as normal and let a real denial (if one happens) trigger §5's
LOCAL-ROUTE fallback. Never repeat the same gated call after a denial.

## 4. Record the approval + merge — decision table

| `requirements`             | `reviewerTokenEnv` | Action |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|--------|
| `none` or `unknown (...)`   | n/a                 | Record the reviewer's verdict as a comment (PR mode: `gh pr comment`; local mode: `board.sh comment`) signed with the reviewer identity, then merge autonomously — no approval step is required. |
| `formal-review-required`    | set                 | `GH_TOKEN="${<that env var>}" gh pr review <n> --approve --body "<justification>"` — a real distinct approver — then merge. |
| `formal-review-required`    | unset               | This is the ONE legitimate blocked-on-human case: post a `board.sh comment`/issue comment naming the missing reviewer token, write a `handoff`, leave the task *In review*. This verdict is recorded ONCE in `.claude/merge-requirements.json` (alongside the `requirements` cache) so the NEXT PR on this repo does not re-ask — it sees the same recorded block and goes straight to the same handoff without a fresh interactive round-trip. |

`none`/`unknown` merging autonomously still needs the recorded verdict
comment first — the recorded independent agent review IS the artifact that
justifies the merge, whether or not GitHub demands a formal approval on top
of it.

Merge with `<cfg:methodology.mergeMethod|squash>` — a per-repo decision made at
setup (the `merge-mode.sh method` subcommand changes it later):

- **squash (default)** collapses the branch into one commit, so carry the
  attribution in the squash body: one `Co-authored-by:` trailer per distinct
  agent author on the branch (from `git log main..<branch> --format='%an <%ae>'`,
  deduped) plus the reviewer, and name who applied it. GitHub links the squash
  commit to the PR, where the original role-attributed commits remain visible.
- **merge** preserves the individual role-attributed commits on main (pick this
  at setup if per-commit attribution in `git log` matters more than linear
  history); **rebase** replays them.

```bash
# mergeMethod = squash (default) — attribution goes in the squash body:
gh pr merge <n> --squash --delete-branch --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
<one-line summary of the task>

Applied-by: <identity.sh orchestrator name> (auto-merge, round <k> approval)
Reviewed-by: <identity.sh reviewer name> (model: <the reviewer model you used>)

Co-authored-by: <each distinct branch author, e.g. Dev Agent - ... <...+dev_agent@...>>
EOF
)"

# mergeMethod = merge or rebase — the branch's own per-role commits carry the
# attribution; no extra body:
gh pr merge <n> --<cfg:methodology.mergeMethod> --delete-branch

board.sh move N "QA"        # then fold the spec delta (build-next §Advancing)
```

Announce the merge to everyone whose work it can invalidate:
- `board.sh comment N` — merged SHA, approver (agent + model), round count.
- SendMessage every OTHER currently-running subagent/teammate of this session
  (if any): "PR #<n> (<task-id>) merged into <mainBranch> — rebase/pull before
  your next push." Skip silently if you have no live teammates.
- If the merged change altered a contract other queued tasks depend on, note
  it in the next `next-task` pick (the spec delta you just folded is the
  record).

Whichever route was taken should be visible, not implicit — state the merge
route in the iteration report (see build-next SKILL.md step 6): the
`requirements` verdict and whether the merge went through `gh pr merge`
normally or via §5's `route: local-route`.

## 5. LOCAL-ROUTE fallback

This is the STANDARD path when `gh pr merge` is hard-blocked by a permission
classifier — most commonly the self-authored-PR floor (the orchestrator's own
account opened the PR, so the harness denies merging it regardless of
`autoMerge` or any settings.json rule) — or when the task's `work.type` is
local (no PR was ever opened). It is not a rare escape hatch: detect the
hard-block ONCE per session and switch routes for good.

This protocol never re-attempts the gated call once a hard block is detected, and it never parks approved work as a standing ask waiting on a human who was never going to be asked to unblock a structural denial anyway.

Route:
1. The recorded verdict comment from §4 already exists (PR comment or issue
   comment, signed with the reviewer identity) — that record is unchanged;
   only the merge MECHANISM changes.
2. Plain-git squash-merge in a clean worktree with role attribution: create a
   temporary worktree off `origin/<mainBranch>`, `git merge --squash
   <branch>`, commit with the same on-behalf attribution recipe as the PR
   path (`identity.sh on-behalf ...` — Applied-by/Reviewed-by/Co-authored-by,
   §Commit identities below), then `git push origin HEAD:<mainBranch>`.
3. close the PR via REST naming the merge SHA (`gh api -X PATCH
   repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<n> -f state=closed`, then a comment naming the
   squash commit SHA that actually carries the change) — the PR record stays
   accurate even though `gh pr merge` never ran.
4. Remove the temporary worktree; continue the loop exactly as if `gh pr
   merge` had succeeded (`board.sh move N "QA"`, announce, fold the delta).

If one of the LOCAL route's OWN steps (the `git push`, or the REST
PATCH-close) itself hits a hard denial, that falls back to the doc's
top-level floor: never retry around a denial — it means ask the human, full
stop. There is no further re-routing exception beyond this documented one.

When `work.type` is `local` from the start (no PR was ever opened, so there
is no §4 PR comment or `gh pr merge` to fall back FROM — this route is the
ONLY route), step 1's recorded verdict is an ISSUE comment instead of a PR
comment, and the board announce carries the merge SHA (not a PR link) since
there is no PR to point at. `work.sync` (governs WHEN, not whether, board
mutations under `work.type: local`) gates each of this route's own board
calls the same way it gates any other event — consult
`bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/work-mode.sh" should-sync <event>`
first; a `defer` here just means the `board.sh move N "QA"` / announce call
waits for the next sync point, never that the merge itself waits.

## Commit identities (`delegation.identities` — ON by default)

Each role's commits carry its own author so `git log`/GitHub show which agent
role did what. Identities are TEMPLATES resolved per-clone by
`bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/identity.sh" <role>` — `{name}` from
`git config user.name`, `{local}`/`{domain}` from `git config user.email` —
so every teammate's clone attributes agent work to their own plus-addressed
email. Defaults: `Dev Agent - {name} <{local}+dev_agent@{domain}>` (reviewer/
orchestrator equivalents). A role set to `null`, `identities: false`, or an
UNRESOLVED report → that role commits as the human.

A commit must reflect ALL participating roles — never default to the
orchestrator alone. Git has three attribution channels; map them to roles:
**author** = who did the work · **committer** = who mechanically recorded it ·
**Co-authored-by trailers** = every OTHER contributing role (e.g. the reviewer
whose findings shaped a fix, or a consulted identity).

Rules:
- **(a) Default — delegate the commit.** The acting subagent commits under its
  OWN identity (dev brief gets the exact `flags:` line from
  `identity.sh dev <task path>` — the covers-selected identity — pasted in). No
  on-behalf recipe needed; author == committer == the actor.
- **(b) On-behalf** — when the orchestrator must record work it did not itself
  author (relaying a reviewer-driven fix, folding a spec delta shaped by
  findings): committer = orchestrator, author = the acting role, Co-authored-by
  = the contributing roles. Get the ready recipe from
  `identity.sh on-behalf <author-role> [--committer <role>] [--co <role>]...` —
  it prints THREE pieces, in paste order: a `flags:` line (`-c user.name/-c
  user.email` for the committer — a GLOBAL git option, goes BEFORE `commit`),
  a `commit-flags:` line (`--author="Name <email>"` — a `git commit`-only
  option, goes AFTER `commit`), and a `trailers:` block. (Pasting `--author`
  into the `flags:` position — i.e. before `commit` — fails with `unknown
  option: --author`; that's exactly the bug this two-line split exists to
  prevent.) Embed all three like the squash-merge `--body` below — the
  `flags:`/`commit-flags:` lines are shell context (already escaped by
  identity.sh) and the raw `trailers:` block goes in the message via a
  **single-quoted** heredoc delimiter (`<<'EOF'`), which is what keeps a hostile
  identity's backticks/`$()` in the trailer text inert:
  ```bash
  # recipe: identity.sh on-behalf dev --co reviewer
  #      -> <flags line> + <commit-flags line> + <trailers block>
  git <paste flags line> commit <paste commit-flags line> -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
  <subject line — the fix in one sentence>

  <paste the trailers block verbatim, e.g.:>
  Co-authored-by: Reviewer Agent - <name> <<local>+reviewer_agent@<domain>>
  EOF
  )"
  ```
  Never use an unquoted `<<EOF` or an interpolated `-m "...<trailers>..."` — either
  would execute metacharacters embedded in a name/email.
- **(c) Orchestrator as AUTHOR** only for its OWN artifacts (retros, design
  briefs, release notes): `identity.sh orchestrator`'s flags, no on-behalf.
- **(d)** An identity may ONLY be used by the process actually acting in that
  role — never commit as Dev when the orchestrator wrote the code; use on-behalf
  (author=dev, committer=orchestrator) so the record is truthful.
- **(e)** Inside this workflow, do NOT append a generic `Co-authored-by: Claude`
  trailer — the role identities ARE the agents; a generic trailer just adds an
  anonymous participant to GitHub's rendering.

The reviewer makes no commits (by design), but `identity.sh reviewer`'s resolved
name signs the approval body (and rides a Co-authored-by trailer when its
findings shaped the merged fix).

Use the per-commit `-c` flags exactly as printed — never `git config` writes
that leak an agent identity into the human's clone. Attribution note: GitHub
renders an avatar/link only when the resolved email belongs to a GitHub
account; plus-addressed mail (`local+tag@domain`) still delivers to the
owner's inbox on Outlook/Gmail/Fastmail. The `agent-identities` skill
shows/edits all of this.
