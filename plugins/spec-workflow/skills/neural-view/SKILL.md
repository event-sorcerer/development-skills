description: Start/stop/status for the live JARVIS-style visualization of the identity brains — notes as neurons, links as synapses, recalls lighting up in real time, plus a project-overview HUD (hover inspection, per-repo board state, best-effort live sessions). Use with 'start', 'stop', or 'status' (default); bare invocation reports status + URL.

# Neural view — the live window into the identity brains

One long-lived page (`http://127.0.0.1:4748`) that draws every identity's brain as a
neural cluster and lights the neurons up as recalls fire. The server reads the brains
READ-ONLY; keep the tab open and watch retrieval happen.

Run the action the user asked for (`status` if unspecified):

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/neural-view.py" start    # background server (idempotent)
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/neural-view.py" status   # RUNNING <url> notes=N brains=N repos=N | STOPPED | STALE: ...
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/neural-view.py" stop [--force]
```

If `status`/`start` report **STALE** instead of STOPPED, a lost/stale pidfile is
hiding a process that still holds the port — the message names the PID/command
when discoverable and points at `stop --force`, which kills the pidfile-tracked
server (if any) and, only when its command line contains `neural-view.py`, the
zombie holding the port too; an unrelated process is reported, never killed.

Report the script's output verbatim. On **start**/**status**, give the user the URL and
add: *open it and leave it open — recalls light up live as the identities read their
brains.* Options: `--port N` (default 4748), `--dir ROOT` (a brains root always included,
marker or not; default none), `--scan BASE` (scan base for marker-based multi-repo
discovery; default `~/Development`) — every immediate child of the scan base with a
`.claude/.neural-network` marker file is aggregated onto the same page as a labeled
"constellation", alongside `--dir` if given. With none of these set and an empty/absent
scan base, falls back to the git root of cwd (single-repo behavior).

The page renders in 3D (three.js, vendored same-origin — no CDN, no build step, zero
external requests): drag to orbit, wheel/pinch to zoom, right-drag or shift-drag to pan,
click a neuron to inspect it, and the ⌂ button (or double-clicking empty space) resets
the view. If `status` says STOPPED, `start` it. Nothing here mutates a brain — it is
purely a viewer.

It's also a one-page overview of every project on the machine: hovering any note, repo
region, or synapse (no click needed) opens a tooltip identifying it; each repo shows its
GitHub Project board state (status counts, in-progress/in-review task titles — read via
this plugin's own `board.sh`, cached, never blocking the page); and locally-discoverable
Claude Code sessions (best-effort, from job metadata only — never transcript content)
badge the repo they're running in. See the plugin README's "Neural view" section for the
full `/projects`/`/sessions` contract and the relevant env vars
(`NEURAL_VIEW_PROJECTS_TTL`, `NEURAL_VIEW_BOARD_TIMEOUT`, `NEURAL_VIEW_CLAUDE_DIR`,
`NEURAL_VIEW_SESSION_RECENT_SECS`).
