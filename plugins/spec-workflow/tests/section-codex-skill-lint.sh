# brackets (< or >) in the `description:` frontmatter, which Codex rejects
# outright (CDX-005) -- but the check is the whole validator, so any future
# name/length/shape violation is caught too. The validator lives OUTSIDE this
# repo (in the skill-creator system skill), so when it is unavailable we SKIP
# with a visible note rather than crashing the suite or spuriously failing an
# environment that simply can't run the external check.
