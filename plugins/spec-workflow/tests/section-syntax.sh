# SUPERSEDED (#45): this section used to also grep scripts/*.sh for the one
# 3.12+-only nested-quote f-string pattern (e.g. f"{it["id"]}"). That check
# now lives in section-snippet-lint.sh's scripts/snippet-lint.py, which
# folds it into a gate-wide version-floor lint over every inline python3 -c
# / heredoc snippet (both scripts/ and tests/) PLUS a bash-3.2-floor
# construct check -- generalizing this single pattern instead of duplicating
# it here. Perturbation-tested before removal: reintroducing this exact
# pattern into a scratch copy of a real script (board.sh) was confirmed
# caught by the new lint (see the retro/PR notes for #45).
