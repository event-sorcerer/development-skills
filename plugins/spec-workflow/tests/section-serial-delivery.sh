# Covers issue #272: methodology.serialDelivery — a stricter, orthogonal mode
# to maxInProgress that gates on MERGE rather than a parallel-lane count. Two
# enforcement points, tested independently:
#   1. next.py's picker: WAIT while a task is In review with nothing In
#      progress to resume (only a merge can unblock it); RESUME (never WAIT)
#      when something IS In progress — resuming/finishing that is always the
#      right next action, and WAIT with nothing In progress to work on would
#      deadlock the loop (review round 1, PR #279, MUST FIX #1).
#   2. guard-board-move.sh: defense in depth against a manual
#      `board.sh move <n> "In progress"` while another task is already
#      In progress/In review, read from the offline board-cache.json (never
#      a network call) — fail OPEN with a warning on a cache miss, and
#      correctly evaluated even when board.sh appears more than once in a
#      compound command (review round 1, MUST FIX #3).
