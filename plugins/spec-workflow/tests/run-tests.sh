# --- section filter (dev#96) ---------------------------------------------
# `--section <name>` restricts the run to sections whose base-name (the file
# name minus the `section-` prefix and `.sh` suffix) CONTAINS <name> as a
# substring. Repeatable and comma-separated: `--section board-queue`,
# `--section a,b`, and `--section a --section b` all work; the union runs in
# the registered SECTIONS order below (so the load-bearing ui-hub ->
# neural-view-lifecycle teardown pairing is preserved whenever both halves
# are selected — filtering to only ONE half is allowed but then that pair's
# create/teardown is a harmless no-op, not a failure). The SPEC_TESTS_SECTION
# env var is an equivalent filter source (comma-separated); it exists so
# gate.sh can DETECT a filtered invocation and refuse to record a pass for it
# — the recorded gate pass must always be a full-suite run (see gate.sh).
# With no filter at all, the run is byte-for-byte identical to before. An
# explicit filter that resolves to no non-empty terms (e.g. `--section=`)
# falls through to the no-match error below, never a crash.

# _filters. Empty terms are ignored (an empty substring would match every
# section); skipping them here — rather than expanding a possibly-empty array
# with `"${arr[@]}"` — also sidesteps bash 3.2's set -u "unbound variable"
# error on an empty array. `set -f` around the split keeps a stray `*` in a
# term from glob-expanding against the cwd.
