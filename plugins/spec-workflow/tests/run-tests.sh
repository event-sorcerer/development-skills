# Thin runner: defines shared state, sources _lib.sh for the shared check*/
# lifecycle_start helpers, then sources each per-area section-*.sh in a fixed
# order. Splitting the old monolith into per-area files lets concurrent build
# lanes add tests to disjoint files instead of all appending to one file
# (guaranteed rebase conflict on every merge). See tests/README.md (if
# present) or the plugin README's test-layout note for how to add a new
# section file.

# Sections are mostly independent (each mints/tears down its own temp dirs
# and ports), EXCEPT one documented pair: section-ui-hub.sh creates the
# _hubtmp temp dir and section-neural-view-lifecycle.sh tears it down (see
# the rm -rf there), so ui-hub MUST precede neural-view-lifecycle below.
# This array's order is otherwise just the original file's top-to-bottom
# order, but that one pair is load-bearing -- don't reorder it blindly.
