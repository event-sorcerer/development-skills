# --- PreToolUse(Bash) hook stdin builders -------------------------------
# Wrap a command string as the {"tool_input":{"command":...}} JSON the
# guard-board-move / guard-pr-create hooks read on stdin. Defined here in
# _lib.sh (always sourced) rather than in one section file so that filtering
# the suite to a single guard section (dev#96 --section) still has them in
# scope -- otherwise the hook gets empty stdin and default-allows, turning
# real assertions into spurious passes/FAILs. hookjson() is the fast printf
# form (callers pre-escape any embedded quotes); hookjsonpy() routes through
# python's json so a command string with arbitrary quoting is encoded safely.

# --- server-lifecycle helpers (SPEC 7.5) ---------------------------------
# Server-lifecycle sections (neural-view, ui-hub) bind a real TCP port. Under
# concurrent build-loop lanes, two runs picking the same fixed port race and
# whichever loses gets a spurious lifecycle failure blamed on its own diff.
# _rand_port() gives each lifecycle section its own per-run random port;
# lifecycle_start() retries a failed start ONCE on a fresh port and reports a
# pass-on-retry as a distinct FLAKY state, so genuine flakes stay visible
# instead of either failing innocent work or being silently swallowed.
_used_ports=()

# development-skills#97: the port-in-use check inside _rand_port() only ever
# sees THIS process's own picks (_used_ports is per-process) -- it has no
# way to know what some OTHER concurrently-running run-tests.sh already
# claimed. Two suites drawing from the same full 20000-39999 band can (and,
# rarely but repeatably under load, did) land on the identical port number.
# When that port then gets reused for a genuine neural-view server in one
# suite while the other suite's kill gate is still looking at it, the gate
# (which only ever asks "who holds MY configured port right now" -- correct
# in isolation, see section-lifecycle-retry.sh's cross-suite gate check)
# kills a completely unrelated process. Fix: slice the band into disjoint
# _PORT_SLICE_COUNT bands of _PORT_SLICE_WIDTH ports each and floor every
# draw by a band chosen from this PROCESS's own PID ($$, guaranteed unique
# among concurrently-running processes on one host) -- two suites now
# collide only if their PIDs happen to be congruent mod _PORT_SLICE_COUNT,
# not on every shared draw. A suite-scoped slice (rather than true
# cross-process bind-first allocation) is sufficient here: nothing but this
# same process ever reads _used_ports, and the port is handed to a spawned
# child (neural-view's "serve"), so there's no way to hold the socket open
# across the handoff anyway.

# _port_base [pid] -- this suite's disjoint port-range floor. Pure function
# of pid (defaults to $$, this process's own PID); exposed separately from
# _rand_port so tests can probe the PID->band mapping with arbitrary pid
# values instead of depending on real spawned PIDs happening to differ.
