# drive the filter end-to-end. A spawned child re-sources every section file,
# including THIS one; without a sentinel the child would spawn again forever
# (and on a pre-filter tree, where --section is ignored, each child runs the
# WHOLE suite). Every spawn below is prefixed _RUNNER_FILTER_META=1; when that
# is set we return immediately so the child skips this section.
