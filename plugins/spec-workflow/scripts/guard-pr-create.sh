# guard-pr-create.sh — PreToolUse(Bash) hook: block `gh pr create` unless the
# PR body references a board issue ("Closes #N"/"Fixes #N" or "<slug>#N"),
# with a remediation message telling the agent to file/pick the issue first
# (issue #76 — board-reflects enforcement, PR-creation side). Also warns
# (never blocks) when the current branch doesn't match
# project.branchPattern.
#
# NOT registered in this plugin's hooks.json — unlike guard-board-move.sh
# (which every consumer gets automatically), this guard is opt-in per
# consumer repo. See the plugin README for the PreToolUse snippet to add to
# a repo's own .claude/settings.json.
#
# Parsing discipline (SW-011): the command string is tokenized with Python's
# stdlib shlex and only the real argv of an actual `gh pr create` invocation
# is inspected — a "#76" sitting in an unrelated argument (a --title value,
# a filename) is never substring-matched as if it were the PR body.
# Shell-interpreter wrapping (`bash -c "gh pr create ..."`, `sh -c '...'`, a
# nested `bash -c 'bash -c "..."'`) is unwrapped the same bounded-depth way
# guard-board-move.sh does; an unbalanced-quote command that still mentions
# gh/pr/create fails closed as unparseable, same as guard-board-move.sh.
#
# Two layers of defense against a heredoc BODY (text being WRITTEN to a
# file, e.g. via `cat > f <<EOF`) being mistaken for a real invocation —
# SW-011's exact false-positive class, since shlex has no concept of
# heredocs and flattens the body into the same token stream as everything
# else:
#
# Layer 1 — heredoc-range exclusion (review round 3, BLOCKING; the round-1
# fix below was NOT sufficient on its own). BEFORE tokenization, a
# lightweight quote-aware line scanner finds each unquoted `<<`/`<<-`
# operator, reads its delimiter (bare or quoted — quoting the delimiter
# only disables expansion inside the body, it does not change what counts
# as the matching terminator line), and drops every line from just after
# the operator through the matching terminator line (word-for-word; `<<-`
# strips leading TABS, only tabs, from both body and terminator lines
# before the comparison, per bash). Those dropped lines never reach
# tokenization at all, so nothing inside them — including a literal `&&`/
# `;`/`gh pr create` sitting in the WRITTEN text — can be scanned, matched,
# or flip any tracking state. `<<<` (here-strings, no body lines) is left
# alone. An unterminated heredoc (no matching terminator line found before
# the command ends) fails closed as unparseable — there's no way to know
# where the body actually ends.
#
# Layer 2 — command-start-position tracking (review round 1). Once heredoc
# bodies are gone, `gh pr create` still only counts as an invocation at a
# genuine command-start position — token 0, or the token right after a
# `;`/`&&`/`||`/`|`/`&` operator — so an argument to some OTHER command
# (e.g. `echo gh pr create`) is still never matched. Leading `VAR=value`
# environment assignments and an `env` prefix are treated as still "before
# the command" so a legitimate `env FOO=bar gh pr create ...` is still
# caught.
#
# Known residual gaps (named honestly, not implied to be covered): the
# line scanner is a lightweight quote-tracker, not a full shell parser — a
# `<<` appearing inside a `$(...)`/backtick command substitution is
# scanned the same as top-level text, which is usually harmless (it's
# still inside quotes or its own nested heredoc syntax) but is not
# specially modeled. A heredoc whose delimiter itself is dynamically built
# (unlikely in practice) is not handled differently from a literal one.
#
# Body sourcing: --body/-b's value is used directly. --body-file/-F's value
# is read from disk UNLESS it is `-` (stdin) — that content is invisible to
# a PreToolUse hook, so it fails closed with a message to use a real file
# instead (mirrors the board-comment-bodies-via-file lesson: pass bodies via
# a file, not a heredoc/stdin, so they stay inspectable here). Neither flag
# given (e.g. `--fill`, an interactive prompt) also fails closed — there is
# nothing to check.
#
# --body-file path resolution (review round 1, BLOCKING): a relative path
# resolves against the hook process's ACTUAL cwd (os.getcwd()) — NOT
# unconditionally against the repo root, which produced false
# blocks/allows whenever the session's cwd was a subdirectory. A leading
# `cd <dir>` (or `pushd <dir>`) at a command-start position BEFORE the `gh
# pr create` match, in the SAME command string, is tracked and folded into
# that resolution too. KNOWN RESIDUAL GAP: a `cd` whose target is a shell
# variable/command-substitution (`cd "$DIR"`), or a `cd` that happened in an
# EARLIER, separate Bash tool call whose runtime doesn't carry cwd forward
# to this hook's own process, is not statically resolvable and is left
# untracked (the guard falls back to its best-known cwd rather than
# guessing).
