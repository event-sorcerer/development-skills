# local-state.sh — reader for scripts/local-state.manifest, the single source of
# truth for which plugin-written runtime paths are gitignored local state
# (`ignore`) vs tracked shared memory (`track`) — SPEC-MEMORY.md §7.1/§7.4/§9.2.
# bash 3.2-compatible; no associative arrays, no external commands beyond the
# manifest read.
#
# Manifest format: one "<policy>\t<path>" record per line; '#'-comment and blank
# lines ignored (see the manifest header).
#
# Sourced use:
#   . "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/lib/local-state.sh"
#   spec_workflow_local_state_paths ignore     # newline-separated ignore paths
#   spec_workflow_local_state_paths track      # newline-separated track paths
#   spec_workflow_local_state_policy .claude/CHECKPOINT   # -> "ignore" (rc 0)
#                                                         # unknown -> rc 1
#   spec_workflow_local_state_manifest         # resolved manifest path
#
# Executed directly (not sourced) it prints the paths for the policy in $1, so a
# caller with no bash context can emit the ignore list:
#   bash "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/lib/local-state.sh" ignore >> .gitignore
#
# $SPEC_WORKFLOW_LOCAL_STATE_MANIFEST overrides the resolved manifest path (tests).
#
# No file-scope `set -uo pipefail`: sourcing (the documented primary interface)
# would otherwise flip nounset+pipefail ON in the caller's shell — a real
# footgun for sourcing callers like gitignore-sync.sh. Every read below is
# already nounset-safe via ${x:-} / ${x:?} defaults, so the options are not
# needed here.
