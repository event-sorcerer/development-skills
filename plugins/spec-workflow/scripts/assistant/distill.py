"""Distiller subsystem (SPEC-ASSISTANT.md Sec5a, Sec9.2, Sec9.5, E3, AST-030,
issue #322, docs/design/ast-E3.md).

Per Sec9.2 the distiller batches every N exchanges (never per-exchange),
minting new notes and bumping touched ones -- v1 does NOT merge, retire, or
aggregate notes (NG3; that is a later, explicitly-gated epic). Per Sec9.5
turns never block on the distiller: `process_batch` below is pure, testable
logic with no threading of its own, and `run_worker` is the loop body
engine.py's `distiller` worker slot (AST-010's WORKER_NAMES registry) binds
instead of its v1 heartbeat no-op -- the request thread that enqueues an
exchange-ref never waits on either of them.

v1 synthesis is DETERMINISTIC-extractive, not LLM: no metered/provider CLI
call is ever made from this module (a background worker calling a provider
would need its own enablement/gating design -- parked for a later epic, per
the design doc's Decisions section). Keyword/entity heuristics only; modest
quality is an accepted, documented trade-off -- the pipeline shape is the
deliverable, not summarization quality.

Every brain write goes through brain.py's library API (mint), which already
holds the identities-wide flock (Sec5a bullet 4/Sec17.5) -- the distiller
worker is the engine's single writer thread for brain mutations, so no
additional locking lives here. brain.py is imported LAZILY (inside functions,
never at module top) so importing distill.py alone never imports brain.py --
the same isolation discipline turns.make_default_recall and this module's
own `refresh_after_mint` already use (Sec17.1: isolation extends to import
time).
