"""Observability / traces subsystem (SPEC-ASSISTANT.md Sec5a, Sec10.1, Sec10.2,
Sec10.4, Sec10.6, Sec10.7, E4, AST-040/AST-042, issue #326/#328,
docs/design/ast-E4.md).

Per Sec10.1/Sec17.7 emitting an event is O(1) and NEVER blocks a turn: `emit`
below only puts an item on a `queue.Queue` (drop + stderr on overflow/failure,
the exact posture `engine.py`'s `_enqueue_distill` already uses for the
distiller, Sec9.5). Per Sec5a/Sec10.2 there is exactly ONE writer thread for
ALL assistants' traces -- the engine's existing `traces` worker slot
(AST-010's `WORKER_NAMES` registry) runs `run_writer` below instead of its v1
heartbeat no-op; per-root sqlite connections are opened and held ONLY by that
thread, so sqlite's single-writer discipline is respected without any
cross-thread handle ever existing.

`emit`/`run_writer` deliberately take the queue as an explicit argument
(`emit(q, root, event)`, not a hidden module-global `emit(root, event)`) --
this matches `distill.py`'s own `run_worker(q, stop_event, ...)` convention
(explicit queue in, no module-level engine singleton) and keeps this module
free of process-wide state a test would have to reset between runs. Callers
(engine.py's instrumentation call sites) pass `self.queues["traces"]`.

Schema (`events` table, one per-root `traces.sqlite`): `seq` (INTEGER,
writer-assigned, monotonic per root, seeded from `MAX(seq)` at open --
Sec10.1's "monotonic, not wall-clock-perfect" ordering requirement; emitters
stay lock-free because nothing but the writer thread ever assigns a seq),
`ts` (ISO-8601 UTC, stamped by `emit` at enqueue time -- the moment the event
actually happened, not when the writer got around to it), `session_id`,
`turn_id`, `span_id`, `parent_span_id` (Sec10.6: an error event links to its
turn via `turn_id`, and MAY carry its own `span_id`/`parent_span_id` like any
other event -- there is no separate error table), `kind` (dotted:
`turn.start`/`turn.end`/`recall.summary`/`provider.call`/`provider.error`/
`distill.batch`/...), `skill`, `modality`, `status`, and a `payload` JSON
column for everything that is not one of the indexed first-class columns.
Every first-class column is indexed so `query()`'s filters are always
index-backed -- Sec10.2 explicitly rules out `json_extract` for time-range/
correlation queries.

Durability (Sec10.7): traces are PRUNABLE history (a later AST-041 retention
pass may delete old rows) -- this module never treats `traces.sqlite` as a
must-survive file the way `store.py` treats `session.jsonl`. WAL mode + a
`busy_timeout` pragma on every connection mean a crash loses at most the
queued-not-yet-drained tail (already-committed rows survive); schema
creation is idempotent (`CREATE TABLE/INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`) so opening an
already-initialized `traces.sqlite` a second time is a no-op, never an
error.

`traces.sqlite` lives at `<root>/.claude/assistant/traces.sqlite` -- the SAME
directory `store.py`'s `session.jsonl`/`session-state.json` already use, and
that directory is ALREADY gitignored wholesale (`scripts/local-state.manifest`:
`ignore\t.claude/assistant/`, AST-005/AST-014) -- no new manifest entry is
needed for this file specifically; it falls under the existing directory
entry, and this docstring records that decision so a later reader does not
go looking for a missing per-file line.

Library:
    emit(q, root, event) -> None
        Enqueue-only; NEVER raises into the caller. `event` is a dict with at
        least `"kind"`; `session_id`/`turn_id`/`span_id`/`parent_span_id`/
        `skill`/`modality`/`status`/`payload` are optional (stored as NULL /
        `{}` when absent). `ts` is stamped here if the caller did not supply
        one.
    run_writer(q, stop_event, poll_timeout=..., max_drain=..., retention_config=None,
               prune_every_drains=..., prune_interval_seconds=...) -> None
        The `traces` worker loop body (engine.py's start() binds this into
        the AST-010 `traces` slot). Runs on its own thread only. AST-041:
        also runs the periodic retention prune pass (see `_prune_all`'s
        docstring) on this same thread, every `prune_every_drains` drain
        cycles OR every `prune_interval_seconds` wall-clock seconds,
        whichever comes first.
    query(root, since=None, turn=None, limit=200) -> list[dict]
        Read-only path for endpoints/terminal (AST-043/AST-045 consume
        this). `since` is a `seq` cursor (rows with `seq > since`), not a
        timestamp -- matches "resume after the last seq I've already seen"
        polling, and stays an indexed-integer-column comparison.
    prune(root, retain_days, max_mb) -> None
        AST-041 (SPEC-ASSISTANT.md Sec10.3): standalone retention pass for
        one root -- opens its own short-lived connection (see its
        docstring for why this differs from the writer thread's own
        internal `_prune_conn` call). `retain_days`/`max_mb` of `0` means
        that knob is unlimited (skipped).
    root_metrics(root) -> dict
        AST-043 (SPEC-ASSISTANT.md Sec10.5): one root's computed metrics as
        a JSON-ready dict -- the same numbers `metrics_text` renders in
        Prometheus text format, shaped for `GET /assistant/metrics`
        instead. See the function's own docstring for the exact shape.
    metrics_text(roots) -> str
        AST-042 (SPEC-ASSISTANT.md Sec10.4): Prometheus text-format 0.0.4
        exposition, computed FRESH from `query()` on every call -- never
        cached beyond one call, never a second history store (Sec10.4:
        "SHALL NOT own history"). `roots` is an iterable of `(label, root)`
        pairs (engine.py's `_metrics_roots_provider` supplies the currently
        enabled ones); see the function's own docstring for the exact
        counters/histogram rendered.
    start_metrics_server(host, port, roots_provider) -> (server, thread)
        AST-042: the stdlib-only (`http.server`, no `prometheus_client`)
        exposition server -- binds `(host, port)`, serves `GET /metrics` as
        `metrics_text(roots_provider())` computed per request. `roots_provider`
        is a zero-arg callable (mirrors `AssistantEngine.__init__`'s
        `repos_getter` convention) so the served root set can change across
        the server's lifetime without a restart. Returns the live
        `(server, thread)` pair so a caller can `server.shutdown()` then
        `thread.join(timeout=...)` for a bounded stop, the same posture
        `engine.py.stop()` already uses for every WORKER_NAMES thread.
