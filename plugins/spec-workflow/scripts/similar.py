"""similar.py — rank board issues by similarity to a query (dedup/near-duplicate detection).

Usage: similar.py <root> "<query>"
Prints ranked matches, one per line, descending by score:
    <tier>\t<score>\t#<number>\t<status>\t<title>
Exit 0 always, even with zero matches (an empty result is a valid answer).

This is a pure scoring function: it takes issue data (open+closed) as input and
never calls gh/board.sh itself (board.sh is the only live board access; wiring
this script to live board.sh output is SW-002's job, not this script's).

Issue source (test/fixture plumbing only, per SW-001 scope):
  $SIMILAR_ISSUES_FILE, if set, names a JSON file shaped {"issues": [{"number",
  "title", "body", "status"}, ...]} — this is how the hermetic test suite
  supplies fixture data. Absent that override, <root>/.claude/tmp/similar-issues.json
  is read if present, else there are no issues to score against (empty output).
  <root> is otherwise unused today; it is accepted (and resolved the same way
  every other script in scripts/ takes a root) so the CLI contract has a stable
  place to grow into once SW-002 pipes live board.sh data through a cache file
  at that path instead of the env var.

Scoring (stdlib only — no numpy/sklearn/embeddings, see SPEC §3 non-goals):
  For each of title and body, take the max of:
    - difflib.SequenceMatcher ratio over normalized word sequences (catches
      near-verbatim rewordings and small insertions/deletions)
    - token Jaccard overlap (catches paraphrases: same words, different order)
  score = max(title_field_score, 0.85 * body_field_score) — title matches count
  fully, body-only matches count slightly less.

Tiers (score bands, re-tunable without a spec delta):
  high   >= 0.60
  medium >= 0.35
  low    >= 0.15
  below 0.15: dropped from output entirely (not a match worth surfacing).
