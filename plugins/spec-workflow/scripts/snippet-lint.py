"""snippet-lint.py — version-floor lint for inline interpreter snippets.

Generalizes the old section-syntax.sh check (one f-string regex) into two
gate-wide floors, over every `scripts/*.sh` and `tests/*.sh` file:

  1. PYTHON FLOOR (3.9) — every inline python3 snippet is parsed with
     `ast.parse(src, feature_version=(3, 9))`. py_compile (see
     section-syntax.sh) only ever sees standalone .py files; it never looks
     inside a shell script's inline snippets, so this is the only static
     check that can see this class of bug before it hits an old interpreter.
     Covers:
       - `python3 -c '...'`  (bash single-quoted -- no interpolation possible)
       - `python3 -c "..."`  (bash double-quoted -- CAN interpolate $vars)
       - `python3 [-m MOD] [-] <<[-]DELIM ... DELIM`     (unquoted heredoc --
         CAN interpolate)
       - `python3 [-m MOD] [-] <<[-]'DELIM'/"DELIM" ... DELIM` (quoted
         heredoc, either quote char -- literal, no interpolation; `<<-`
         additionally strips each line's leading tabs, per POSIX)

     `-m MOD` CAVEAT (a real, reproduced false-positive risk, not just a
     theoretical one -- deliberately accepted, not silently narrowed away):
     `python3 -m MODULE <<...` hands the heredoc to MODULE's own stdin,
     which is not always python source at all -- e.g. `python3 -m json.tool
     <<EOF` feeds JSON to the tool, never executes it as python. This script
     still treats every `-m MOD` heredoc as a python-source candidate for
     lint coverage (there are zero such heredocs in this repo today, and a
     real one that DOES read source from stdin, e.g. a profiler/debugger
     invoked with an explicit `-` script argument, needs the same floor
     check as any other snippet). A future `-m MOD` heredoc whose module
     consumes genuinely non-python stdin data (unlike JSON, whose literal
     grammar happens to be a syntactic subset of Python's -- even bare
     `true`/`null` parse as valid, if meaningless, python identifiers) WILL
     produce a spurious floor finding here. That's an accepted, LOUD
     false-positive (never silent): fix it by exempting that one heredoc
     explicitly when it happens, not by narrowing this regex pre-emptively.
     There is deliberately no `bash4-ok`-style marker for this path -- it's
     a python-floor finding, not a bash-floor one, and the fix is to
     exclude the specific call, not to suppress the message.

     A double-quoted `-c` argument or an unquoted heredoc can embed real bash
     interpolation ($var, ${var}, $(...), `...`) that this script can't
     evaluate without a live shell. Best-effort: each interpolation site is
     replaced with a syntactically-neutral placeholder token before parsing
     (see NEUTRALIZE_PLACEHOLDER below) -- this is sound for the common case
     (interpolation sits inside an already-valid python string/expression)
     but is NOT a real bash parser, so a construct it can't safely bound
     (unterminated string/heredoc, unbalanced $(...)/${...}) is reported as
     an explicit UNSCANNED finding rather than silently skipped or fed
     to ast.parse as probably-garbled text.

     EMPIRICAL CAVEAT (verified on CPython 3.13, not assumed): feature_version
     rejects GRAMMAR additions -- match statements (<3.10), except* (<3.11),
     PEP 695 type-parameter syntax and the `type` statement (<3.12) -- but it
     does NOT reject the PEP 701 tokenizer relaxation that lets an f-string
     nest its own quote char in a `{}` expression, e.g. f"{d["id"]}"
     (3.12+-only; SyntaxError on the stock python3 shipped with macOS <= 14,
     Ubuntu <= 22.04, Debian 11/12, RHEL 8/9). Confirmed directly:
     `ast.parse('x = f"{d["id"]}"\\n', feature_version=(3, 9))` parses
     without error -- that's a lexer change feature_version's compatibility
     shim doesn't model, not a grammar production it can flag. So the regex
     this script inherits from the old check (NESTED_QUOTE_FSTRING_RE below)
     remains the ONLY layer that catches that one pattern; feature_version
     covers every other version-gated construct. Never requires an old
     interpreter to be installed -- both layers are static.

  2. BASH FLOOR (3.2) — every .sh file itself is scanned for bash-4+
     constructs: mapfile/readarray, `declare -A`, `${var,,}`/`${var^^}` case
     conversion, `${var:off:-len}` negative-length substrings, and `&>>`.
     A same-line `# bash4-ok: <reason>` marker comment suppresses one finding
     when the construct is unavoidable (grep -n 'bash4-ok:' to audit them) --
     the reason after the colon must be non-empty (non-whitespace) text, or
     the marker is not honored: a bare `# bash4-ok:` with nothing after it
     documents nothing and is treated as absent.

Scope: markdown-embedded snippets in skills/ were surveyed (SW-045) and found
to only ever invoke standalone .py scripts (e.g. `python3
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/foo.py"`), never inline bodies -- py_compile
already covers those files, so markdown extraction is not implemented (no
inline snippet exists there to miss).

Usage: snippet-lint.py <plugin-dir>
Exit 0, no output, when clean. Otherwise one `path:line: message` finding per
line on stdout, and exit 1.
