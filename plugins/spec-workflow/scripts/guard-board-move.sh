# guard-board-move.sh — PreToolUse(Bash) hook: block `board.sh move <n> "In review"`
# unless gate.sh recorded a pass for the CURRENT tree state. Exit 2 = block (stderr
# goes back to the model); exit 0 = allow. Must stay fast — it runs on every Bash call.
#
# Parsing: the command string is tokenized with Python's stdlib shlex, then every
# `board.sh` argv token is located and its real argv[1] (subcommand) and argv[3]
# (target status) are read at their actual positions. Only an actual `move`
# invocation whose target status is the review-gate status can block; a status
# name appearing anywhere else — comment bodies, gh issue text, heredocs, other
# arguments — never trips the guard, and non-`move` subcommands always pass.
# Compound commands (`A && B`) are handled naturally: shlex still tokenizes the
# whole line, so the board.sh segment's argv is found regardless of what's
# before or after it.
#
# Shell-interpreter wrapping (`bash -c "board.sh move ..."`, `sh -c '...'`,
# an `env`-prefixed variant, or nested `bash -c 'bash -c "..."'`) would hide
# the real argv inside a single opaque token if we only scanned once — that
# was a silent gate bypass. So when a bash/sh/zsh/dash/ksh token is followed
# by a `-c`-ish flag (including combined clusters like `-lc`), the next token
# is treated as an inner command line and re-tokenized recursively (bounded
# depth; deeper nesting fails closed as unparseable, same as a raw unbalanced
# quote would).
#
# Fail-closed exception: if shlex can't tokenize a command/sub-command (e.g. an
# unbalanced quote) AND the raw text still contains both "board.sh" and "move",
# we can't prove it's safe, so we block with a distinct message rather than
# risk letting a real move through unparsed.
#
# #272 (methodology.serialDelivery, defense in depth): a `board.sh move <n>
# "In progress"` is ALSO intercepted below when the config has serialDelivery
# on, blocking it if the offline .claude/board-cache.json (issue #78 — no
# network call) shows another issue already In progress or In review.
# Deliberately fail OPEN (allow, with a stderr warning) when the cache is
# missing/unreadable: a cache-consistency problem must never wedge the build
# loop the way a real network outage would if this were gate-checked instead.
# SERIAL_DELIVERY_OVERRIDE=1 bypasses the block outright (documented escape
# hatch for an intentional manual override).
