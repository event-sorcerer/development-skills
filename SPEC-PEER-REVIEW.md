# Peer review + remote LLM dispatch — spec

Status: APPROVED — registered in `.claude/project.yaml` as spec `peer` (taskPrefix `PRV`).
Source design: [docs/design/compute-registry-plan-v3.md](docs/design/compute-registry-plan-v3.md),
drafted by a Fable 5 agent, reviewed inline, with OQ-1/OQ-2/OQ-3/OQ-4 decided below.
**Decision (per v3 §5, item 1): Spec A and Spec B are folded into this single spec** — B
shrank to a YAML file, one status command, and one HTTP helper, which is a follow-up epic,
not a document. E0 = `/peer-review`, E1 = remote dispatch.

## §1 Overview

Two small, independent capabilities for getting a second LLM's opinion on code. First, a
`/peer-review` skill that pipes a diff to the locally installed `codex exec` CLI (read-only
sandbox) and reports its findings as clearly external review. Second, a minimal remote-compute
layer for the owner's llama.cpp notebook: a git-tracked YAML naming the machine, a status
command that curls it, and a synchronous dispatch helper — no service, no daemon, no queue.
Single owner, two machines; that scale is a design input, not a temporary limitation.

## §2 Goals

- **G1** — From any repo, one command produces an external codex review of the current
  branch's diff, with structured findings, without ever modifying the working tree (§6).
- **G2** — The llama.cpp notebook is reachable as a declared provider: `status` reports
  whether it is up and why not, and a helper function can send it a prompt and get text back
  within a bounded timeout (§7, §8).
- **G3** — Zero persistent processes are added anywhere: everything runs at the moment of
  use and leaves nothing running (§9 invariants).

## §3 Non-goals

- No registry service, heartbeat agent, TTL/staleness model, or capability-ceiling model
  (deleted in v3 §3.5 — do not rebuild them speculatively).
- No async job-queue interface (`submit`/`collect`/`cancel`) — llama.cpp is blocking
  request/response; the interface is one synchronous function.
- No provider-selection layer — one provider per capability at this scale; the caller names
  the provider it wants.
- No `remove`/`enable`/`disable`/`token rotate`/`serve`/`ping`/`doctor`/`logs` subcommands —
  all reduce to hand-editing a ~10-line YAML (v3 §3.5).
- No `/compute-registry add` interview skill. **Decision:** cut (v3 §5 flagged it as a close
  call); its one automatable value — printing the exact `llama-server` launch command — moves
  into the skill's reference doc as a copyable block next to the YAML template.
- No auto-fix in `/peer-review` (consistent with this repo's `/code-review`; `--fix` is a
  possible later opt-in, not v1).
- ComfyUI / image/video/3D generation — explicitly out of scope. Hard requirement carried
  forward verbatim for whatever future spec adds it: *only ever dispatch pre-authored,
  repo-committed workflow templates, never dynamically constructed graphs* (v3 §3.6). A
  "just curl it" design is wrong for ComfyUI; it is a deliberately heavier future spec, not
  a third provider here. Tracked as board issue #166 (spike).
- No wiring of the remote provider into `/peer-review` in v1 (decided, see §12 OQ-4).

## §4 Glossary

- **Peer review** — a review produced by a non-Claude model, presented as external findings,
  never silently merged into Claude's own judgment.
- **codex** — the OpenAI `codex` CLI; `codex exec --sandbox read-only` is the only
  invocation form used (its default sandbox).
- **Provider** — one machine+endpoint entry in the registry YAML (1:N — one file, many
  providers; v1 ships with exactly one: the llama.cpp notebook).
- **Registry** — the git-tracked file `.claude/compute-registry.yaml`; the sole source of
  endpoints and token references. Hand-edited.
- **Dispatch** — one synchronous HTTP POST to a provider's `chat/completions` with a bearer
  token and a timeout, returning text.
- **Status check** — `GET <endpoint>/models` with the bearer token; 200 = reachable.

## §5 Architecture

Two independent verticals; neither depends on the other (E0 ships first and alone).

**E0 — `/peer-review`**: skill (SKILL.md) + one tested script. The script computes the diff
(`git diff <mainBranch>...HEAD` default; `--base`, `--staged`, or `gh pr diff` for a PR
number), embeds it in the prompt, and shells out to `codex exec --sandbox read-only
--output-schema <findings schema>`. Findings shape mirrors ReportFindings: file, line,
severity, summary, failure scenario, overall verdict. Why codex directly and not via the
registry: it is local, needs no endpoint/token, and hardcoding removes a whole config surface
(v3 Spec A). **Plugin placement (OQ-1, decided): standalone `plugins/peer-review`.**

**E1 — remote dispatch**: three artifacts, no processes. (1) `.claude/compute-registry.yaml`
(schema below) — durable, git-tracked, hand-edited. (2) `/compute-registry status` — reads
the YAML, curls each provider's `/models`, reports reachable/unreachable + why. (3) a dispatch
helper — `dispatch(provider_id, prompt, timeout_s) -> text` — usable by any future skill. Why
synchronous-at-use instead of heartbeat: strictly fresher than any TTL window and requires
nothing running when idle (v3 §3.5). Lives in the same `plugins/peer-review` plugin as E0
(OQ-1) — both skills, no board dependency.

Registry schema (v1, `schemaVersion: 1` literal):

```yaml
schemaVersion: 1
providers:
  - id: notebook-llama
    endpoint: http://192.168.1.42:8080/v1   # llama-server OpenAI-compatible endpoint
    token: ${LLAMA_NOTEBOOK_TOKEN}           # env-var reference, never an inline literal
```

**Decision:** the v3 `capabilities:` list is dropped from the schema — it existed to feed
the deleted capability-ceiling/selection model and nothing consumes it now; the provider `id`
is the whole addressing story. (Re-add as a plain informational field if a consumer appears.)

Notebook-side setup is one documented command, no custom process:
`llama-server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --api-key "$LLAMA_NOTEBOOK_TOKEN"` (plus the
one-time Windows Defender inbound-LAN allow rule for the port).

House constraints apply: bash 3.2-compatible / stdlib-python scripts, scripts decide — the
model obeys.

## §6 `/peer-review` skill (E0)

- **§6.1** WHEN `/peer-review` is invoked with no arguments THE SYSTEM SHALL review the diff
  `git diff <mainBranch>...HEAD`, where `<mainBranch>` comes from repo config when available
  and falls back to `main`.
- **§6.2** THE SYSTEM SHALL invoke codex exclusively as `codex exec` with `--sandbox
  read-only`; no flag or argument path SHALL produce a write-capable sandbox.
- **§6.3** WHEN `--base <ref>`, `--staged`, or a PR number is given THE SYSTEM SHALL take the
  diff from `git diff <ref>...HEAD`, `git diff --staged`, or `gh pr diff <n>` respectively.
- **§6.4** IF the computed diff is empty THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL report "nothing to review"
  and exit 0 without invoking codex.
- **§6.5** THE SYSTEM SHALL request findings via `--output-schema` in the shape {file, line,
  severity, summary, failure scenario} plus an overall verdict, and render them under the
  label "External review — codex".
- **§6.6** IF the codex output fails to parse against the schema THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL print
  the raw output verbatim with a note that structured parsing failed, and SHALL NOT crash
  (known codex `--output-schema` rough edge, v3 Spec A).
- **§6.7** IF `codex` is not on `PATH` THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL fail with a nonzero exit and
  printed install instructions.
- **§6.8** IF codex authentication fails THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL surface codex's own stderr
  and SHALL NOT prompt for an API key in-conversation.
- **§6.9** THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT modify any file as part of a review (no auto-fix path
  exists in v1).
- **§6.10** THE SYSTEM SHALL state in the skill's user-facing doc that reviewing a diff via
  `codex exec` sends that diff to OpenAI's cloud.

## §7 Compute registry file + status (E1)

- **§7.1** THE SYSTEM SHALL read providers exclusively from `.claude/compute-registry.yaml`;
  IF `schemaVersion` is not the literal `1` THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL fail with an actionable
  error (no migration machinery in v1).
- **§7.2** IF a provider's `token` field is not an `${ENV_VAR}` reference (i.e. it looks
  like an inline literal secret) THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL refuse to use that provider and say
  why — tokens never live in the git-tracked file.
- **§7.3** IF a referenced token env var is unset at run time THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL fail
  with an error naming the missing variable.
- **§7.4** WHEN `/compute-registry status` is invoked THE SYSTEM SHALL, for each provider,
  `GET <endpoint>/models` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and a per-provider timeout,
  and report reachable (200) or unreachable with the reason (timeout, connection refused,
  401/403, non-200). **Decision:** the status check sends the bearer token because
  `llama-server --api-key` protects `/models` too; an unauthenticated probe would
  false-negative.
- **§7.5** WHEN `status` reports a provider unreachable THE SYSTEM SHALL point at the
  reference doc containing the YAML template and the exact `llama-server` launch command
  (the surviving value of the cut `add` flow).

## §8 Dispatch helper (E1)

- **§8.1** WHEN `dispatch(provider_id, prompt, timeout_s)` is called THE SYSTEM SHALL POST
  to `<endpoint>/chat/completions` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and return the
  response text. No pre-flight health check — the POST's own failure is the freshest signal.
- **§8.2** IF `provider_id` is not in the registry THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL fail with the list
  of known provider ids.
- **§8.3** IF the request exceeds `timeout_s` THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL fail with a nonzero
  exit and a timeout message naming the provider; THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT retry automatically
  in v1.
- **§8.4** IF the provider returns a non-200 status THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL surface the HTTP
  status and a bounded tail of the response body.
- **§8.5** THE SYSTEM SHALL never include the resolved token value in any output, log, or
  error message (redact if it would appear, e.g. in echoed curl commands).

## §6.11 Dynamic model selection

- **§6.11.0** THE SYSTEM SHALL resolve the diff (§6.1/§6.3/§6.4) BEFORE performing any model
  discovery. IF the diff is empty THEN model discovery SHALL NOT run — §6.4's existing
  guarantee ("codex is never invoked" on an empty diff) extends to `codex debug models`, not
  only `codex exec`.
- **§6.11.1** WHEN `/peer-review` is invoked with a non-empty diff THE SYSTEM SHALL discover
  available codex models by running `codex debug models`, filtering to entries with
  `visibility == "list"` AND `supported_in_api == true` AND a valid `slug` (non-empty string)
  and `priority` (integer, not boolean) — `display_name`/`description`, if missing or
  non-string, default to the `slug` and an empty string respectively rather than excluding the
  model — and sorting the eligible result by `priority` ascending.
- **§6.11.2** IF exactly one model is eligible THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL use it directly without
  asking. IF two or more models are eligible THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL present at most the
  top 4 (by §6.11.1's priority-ascending order) to the human via `AskUserQuestion` — which
  accepts 2–4 options — one option per model, recommending (first-listed, labeled
  "Recommended") the lowest-`priority` eligible model. No other recommendation heuristic (e.g.
  diff-size-aware weighting) is used.
- **§6.11.3** WHEN a model is chosen THE SYSTEM SHALL invoke `codex exec` with `-m <chosen
  slug>` in addition to the existing `--sandbox read-only --output-schema` flags (§6.2, §6.5).
  `-m` SHALL always be added strictly after `--sandbox read-only` is fixed in the constructed
  command — no model selection is capable of relaxing or altering the sandbox flag (§6.2 is
  unaffected by this addition).
- **§6.11.4** IF model discovery fails — `codex` is not on `PATH`, `codex debug models` exits
  nonzero, its output is not valid JSON, or zero models survive the §6.11.1 filter — THEN THE
  SYSTEM SHALL skip model selection entirely and invoke `codex exec` with no `-m` flag (the
  pre-PRV-004 default behavior). A discovery failure SHALL NOT block or fail the review.

## §9 Invariants

- A peer review NEVER writes: every codex invocation uses `--sandbox read-only`; the review
  path contains no file-modifying code.
- Secrets never enter git: registry token fields are env-var references only; any inline
  literal is a refusal, not a warning.
- Resolved token values never appear in stdout, stderr, logs, or error messages.
- No persistent process, daemon, heartbeat, or background agent is installed on any machine
  by this work; everything runs synchronously at the moment of use.
- Content leaves the machine only to endpoints explicitly declared in
  `.claude/compute-registry.yaml`, or to OpenAI via the user-installed `codex` CLI — and the
  latter is disclosed in the skill doc.
- External-model findings are always labeled with their source and never presented as, or
  silently merged into, Claude's own judgment.
- Scripts are bash 3.2-compatible / stdlib-only Python, `set -uo pipefail`,
  shellcheck-clean (house rule, SPEC.md §9).

## §10 Non-functional

- `/compute-registry status` with one provider completes in under ~10 s worst case
  (per-provider health-check timeout, default 5 s — §12 OQ-3, decided).
- Dispatch timeout default 120 s (§12 OQ-2, decided); always finite — no unbounded waits.
- No new runtime dependencies beyond `curl`, `git`, `gh`, and the user-installed `codex`.
- `/peer-review` adds negligible overhead beyond the codex call itself (diff computation +
  one subprocess).

## §11 Testing strategy

Merge gate = the repo's hermetic suite (`tests/run-tests.sh` conventions) + `shellcheck -x`.
All merge-gating tests are deterministic and offline:

- **E0** — a fake `codex` binary on `PATH` (fixture stdout: valid findings JSON, malformed
  JSON, auth-failure stderr, missing binary) exercises §6.2 and §6.4–§6.8; diff-source
  selection (§6.1/§6.3) tested against a fixture git repo; PR path via the existing fake-gh
  harness.
- **E1** — fixture YAML files (valid, bad schemaVersion, inline-literal token, unknown id)
  cover §7.1–§7.3 and §8.2; HTTP paths (§7.4, §8.1, §8.3–§8.5) run against a local stub
  server on a per-run randomized port — 200, 401, 500, and a hang for the timeout case;
  token-redaction asserted on every error output.
- Real-codex and real-notebook runs are manual/advisory only, never merge-gating (network +
  model nondeterminism).

## §12 Open questions

| id | question | owner | default if unanswered | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OQ-1 | Plugin placement: new `plugins/peer-review` plugin vs skills inside `plugins/spec-workflow`? | user | new standalone plugin `plugins/peer-review` housing both skills — neither depends on the board workflow, and spec-workflow's scope stays clean | **decided: standalone `plugins/peer-review`** |
| OQ-2 | Dispatch call default timeout (v3 §5) | user | 120 s (long enough for a big diff on notebook-class hardware, short enough to fail a hung session) | **decided: 120s (default applied)** |
| OQ-3 | Status health-check per-provider timeout | user | 5 s | **decided: 5s (default applied)** |
| OQ-4 | Wire the remote provider into `/peer-review` as an opt-in backend flag? | user | not in v1 — dispatch helper is validated by its own tests + a documented manual invocation; revisit once the notebook proves useful | **decided: not in v1** |
| OQ-5 | Where does the ComfyUI hard requirement (§3 non-goals) get recorded so a future spec inherits it? (v3 §5) | orchestrator | it is recorded verbatim in this spec's §3; any future generation spec must cite it in its seed context | **decided: recorded in §3, plus board issue #166** |
