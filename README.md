# development-skills

A [Claude Code plugin marketplace](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugin-marketplaces) of development-workflow plugins.

## Install

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add Zugruul/development-skills
claude plugin install spec-workflow@development-skills
```

Or per-repo (shared with everyone opening the repo) via `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
    "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
        "development-skills": {
            "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "Zugruul/development-skills" }
        }
    },
    "enabledPlugins": { "spec-workflow@development-skills": true }
}
```

## Tooling

### Neural View

![](./docs/neural-view.png)

Visualization of "brains" that help guide development and knowledge base over each project. With help of RAG in addition to semantic search we are able to probe it for information.

### UI Mode

![](./docs/ui-mode-example.png)
![](./docs/ui-mode-annotate.png)
![](./docs/ui-mode-accessibility.png)

Allows quick iterations over UI before its implementation. With i18n and theming support. Also supports a11y checks to ensure that you are delivering the best accessibility and testability possible as well. 

## Update

Pull the latest skills from this repo at any time:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update development-skills
```

or open `/plugin` in Claude Code and use **Update now** on the `development-skills` marketplace.

## Codex support (in progress)

Dual-host support for [OpenAI Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex) is landing incrementally — `spec-workflow` and `scaffold-project` already ship a `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` and are installable from a repo-local `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, and an end-to-end smoke test proves a real Codex session can discover and run an installed skill. A Codex-side agent working in this repo should start at [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for orientation (Claude Code reads [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md), a one-line pointer to the same file). Full install/invocation docs for Codex, a per-host compatibility matrix, and CI coverage are tracked in [`docs/BACKLOG-CODEX-COMPAT.md`](docs/BACKLOG-CODEX-COMPAT.md) (epics E1–E4) and will land here once that work ships — `.claude/` remains the canonical, always-supported host in the meantime.

## Assistant observability (in progress)

The in-repo assistant (`SPEC-ASSISTANT.md`) records every turn as an event in a
per-repo, gitignored `.claude/assistant/traces.sqlite` (append-only, WAL mode).
Retention is pruned automatically by a single background writer thread, oldest
events first, configured per repo via `assistant.observability.traces.sqlite`
in `project.yaml`:

```yaml
assistant:
  observability:
    traces:
      sqlite:
        retainDays: 30   # delete events older than N days; 0 = unlimited
        maxMB: 500        # trim oldest events until the file is under N MB; 0 = unlimited
```

Both knobs default to `30`/`500` when omitted. Retention only ever touches
`traces.sqlite` — it never deletes the embeddings index, `session.jsonl`, or
any other local-state file. Full observability epic tracked in
[`docs/design/ast-E4.md`](docs/design/ast-E4.md).

## Testing

```bash
bash plugins/spec-workflow/tests/run-tests.sh    # hermetic: validator fixtures + preflight (CI runs this + shellcheck + manifest validation)
claude plugin eval plugins/spec-workflow         # skill evals (early access; needs API credits)
```

The evals exercise the skills on real models — including smaller ones (`--model sonnet`) —
to keep them simple-model-proof.

## Local development

To hack on the skills, point the marketplace at your clone instead — with a
`directory` source, skill edits reach new sessions immediately (no version bump):

```bash
claude plugin marketplace remove development-skills
claude plugin marketplace add /path/to/development-skills
```

## Plugins

### spec-workflow

Spec-driven autonomous build workflow. A repo declares its boards, specs, epics, guards, gate command, delegation roster, and conventions in a **versioned YAML config** (`.claude/project.yaml`, schemaVersion 2 — schema in `plugins/spec-workflow/schemas/`, wired for editor hover/autocomplete via a `# yaml-language-server` modeline; needs PyYAML); the plugin's skills and scripts read that config through one shared loader, so the same workflow drives any project. A legacy `.claude/project.json` (schemaVersion 1) is still read and auto-converted (deprecated).

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `craft-spec` | Assisted spec creation: interview → draft → review → backlog |
| `setup-project` | Bootstrap a repo: config, GitHub Project board, validation |
| `setup-assistant` | Scaffold a bare-brain assistant repo (marker, project.yaml assistant section, brain dirs, persona AGENTS.md, gitignores) and edit its settings |
| `seed-board` | Create issues + board items from a spec's backlog (idempotent) |
| `board` | All board reads/writes (single script, no hardcoded ids) |
| `next-task` | Prioritized + sequenced + guarded pick; reads human comments |
| `queue` | Read-only view of the upcoming build-next picks, priority-first, with blocked reasons |
| `find-task` | Ranked search of existing board issues by title/body similarity (dedup) |
| `create-inbound` | Search-first, dedup-gated capture of ad-hoc ideas/bugs/requests onto the board |
| `implement-task` | One task via TDD, delegated to a dev subagent with a what/how/why brief |
| `ui-options` | Iterative UI mode: human picks the UI from an options page (favorite + aspects) |
| `gate` | The project's single green-before-advance quality command |
| `build-next` | One full loop iteration — drive with `/loop /spec-workflow:build-next` |
| `brain` | Per-identity zettel memory: private brains, spreading-activation recall, retro mint/prune/graduate |
| `auto-merge` | Toggle autonomous PR review + merge (reviewer agent approves instead of a human) |
| `pr-review-model` | Show/set the model the autonomous PR reviewer runs on |
| `agent-identities` | Per-role commit attribution — each person's clone signs agent commits with their own plus-addressed email |
| `concurrency` | Show/set `methodology.maxInProgress` — sequential (default) vs N parallel implementation lanes |
| `checkpoint` | Pause/resume the loop via a local flag file |
| `handoff` | Session/pause handoff document |
| `dev-up` | Bring up the project's dev stack for QA |
| `neural-view` | Live JARVIS-style visualization of the identity brains — notes as neurons, recalls lighting up in real time |
| `feedback` | Structured per-iteration process feedback about the workflow itself (`methodology.feedback`); triaged into backlog/brain-note/graduate/upstream/ignore at retro time |
| `sync-project-configs` | Discover every anchored repo and bring its `.claude/project.yaml` up to the plugin's current config surface via versioned sync rules; dry-run by default |
| `changelog-generate` | Read-only: Markdown changelog section from git log grouped by conventional-commit type, since the last `spec-workflow--v*` tag; `--write <file>` to prepend |

Humans steer the loop by commenting on task issues: `next-task`/`implement-task` read every comment before starting, fold accepted changes into the issue's acceptance criteria, and reply on the issue.

### scaffold-project

Scaffolds a new greenfield project's minikube dev-workflow scripts
(start/stop/dev/build/port-forward/bootstrap) into a `scripts/` folder, with
`package.json` wired to run them.

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scaffold-project` | Generate a project's minikube dev-workflow scripts from templates, every profile bound explicitly (`MK_PROFILE`, never minikube's shared default) so scaffolded projects never collide with each other |

```bash
claude plugin install scaffold-project@development-skills
```
