# Design — cdx/E1: Portable interaction & invocation semantics
Grounded in: SPEC-CODEX-COMPAT.md §7.1-§7.3, §4 Glossary (Capability language, Host adapter), §5 Architecture

## CDX-010 — capability-language rewrite: the 9 `AskUserQuestion` skills (§7.1)

**§7.1 exact text**: "WHERE a skill needs structured user input THE SYSTEM SHALL describe it in capability language ('ask through the host's structured-input facility when available; otherwise ask one concise direct question') in the shared `SKILL.md`, with any exact tool call isolated to a `references/host-claude.md` adapter."

**Glossary definitions** (§4): **Capability language** — "skill prose that describes what must happen ('ask the user through the host's structured-input facility') instead of naming an exact host tool (`AskUserQuestion`)." **Host adapter** — "the smallest isolated piece of a skill (a `references/host-<name>.md` doc...) that differs per host; everything else is shared."

**Canonical phrase** (this task establishes it — first host-adapter work in the repo, no prior precedent to match): replace "AskUserQuestion" in shared prose with **"the host's structured-input facility"**, matching §7.1's own worked example verbatim. Where the current text says "AskUserQuestion (header 'X')" write "the host's structured-input facility (header 'X')". Where it says "call AskUserQuestion" write "invoke the host's structured-input facility" or "ask through the host's structured-input facility" (vary naturally per sentence, don't robotically find-replace).

**Inventory — exactly 9 `SKILL.md` files** (confirmed via `grep -rl AskUserQuestion plugins/spec-workflow/skills/*/SKILL.md`): `setup-project`, `auto-merge`, `build-next`, `pr-review-model`, `agent-identities`, `concurrency`, `craft-spec`, `ask-identity`, `create-inbound`.

**`allowed-tools` frontmatter is OUT OF SCOPE** — per §12's own invariant ("`name` and `description` are the only frontmatter fields either host is assumed to enforce; `allowed-tools` remains a Claude-only enhancement, never the cross-host security boundary"), the frontmatter `allowed-tools: ... AskUserQuestion ...` lines (present in `auto-merge`, `pr-review-model`, `agent-identities`, `concurrency`, `ask-identity`) are left UNCHANGED. Only prose BODIES are rewritten, matching the acceptance criterion's own wording ("shared `SKILL.md` bodies").

**Adapter strategy — simple (inline) vs complex (dedicated file)**, per the task's own "only where the skill's complexity warrants a separate file; simple cases may inline a one-line Claude note":
- **Complex → dedicated `references/host-claude.md`**: `craft-spec` (an interview LOOP — "rounds of at most 4 questions using the question bank," plus a separate sign-off loop — enough structure to warrant its own file) and `setup-project` (THREE distinct structured-input moments across different phases — new/existing project choice, merge policy with a follow-up sub-question, feedback opt-in — multi-decision-point complexity).
- **Simple → inline one-line Claude note**, appended near the (now capability-language) mention: `auto-merge`, `build-next`, `pr-review-model`, `agent-identities`, `concurrency`, `ask-identity`, `create-inbound`. Inline note pattern: `(On Claude Code, this is the AskUserQuestion tool.)` — placed once per skill, near its first capability-language mention, not repeated at every occurrence within the same file.

**Constraints to preserve verbatim** (acceptance criterion: "constraints... are preserved"), per skill — from the research inventory:
- `craft-spec`: max 4 questions per interview round; the sign-off loop iterates until approved.
- `auto-merge`: "put the CURRENT state's opposite first" (option-ordering rule, state-dependent) for its first ask; a second, simpler 2-option ask for pre-authorization.
- `ask-identity`: exactly 3 options, exact wording ("It is" / "It is not" / "I'm unsure").
- `create-inbound`: stop/continue semantics — "If the human is absent or does not answer, do NOT create."
- `pr-review-model`: 4 options + a free-text "Other" affordance, no previews.
- `agent-identities`, `concurrency`: 3 options each, current-value-noted framing.
- `setup-project`: 3 distinct asks (new/existing project; merge policy + sub-question; feedback opt-in with a Recommended default).
- `build-next`: the session-consent-gate single-ask (§0 of auto-review.md) AND the separate NEGATIVE operating rule ("does not use [the structured-input facility] unless a hard permission denial or an explicit instruction requires human direction") — both must survive the rewrite, the second one is not a request-input call at all, just a behavioral constraint mentioning the facility by (now capability) name.

**Existing test needing rewrite** (not just addition): `plugins/spec-workflow/tests/section-skill-contracts.sh:71` currently asserts the LITERAL string `"does not use AskUserQuestion unless a hard permission denial..."` is present in build-next's body — this exact assertion will start failing once that sentence is rewritten in capability language, by design (that's the whole point of the acceptance criterion: "none of the 9 shared SKILL.md bodies require a tool literally named AskUserQuestion to function"). Update this existing check's expected string to match the new capability-language wording — do not just delete the check, keep the same operating-rule constraint covered.

**New tests**: for the 2 complex skills, assert their new `references/host-claude.md` file exists and contains the preserved constraint (e.g. craft-spec's "4 questions" number, the exact tool name `AskUserQuestion` — the adapter file is exactly where that literal name is SUPPOSED to still live). For all 9 skills' `SKILL.md` bodies, assert the literal string `AskUserQuestion` is ABSENT (this is the core acceptance criterion, directly testable) while the capability-language phrase IS present.

## Out of scope for CDX-010
CDX-011 (plan-mode/no-write phase capability language, §7.2) and CDX-012 (delegation-spawn capability language, §7.3) — separate, later tasks in this same epic, sharing the "capability language" pattern this task establishes but touching different Claude-specific mechanisms (`EnterPlanMode`/`ExitPlanMode`, `Agent`/`subagent_type`).
`allowed-tools` frontmatter changes — explicitly out of scope per §12's invariant, see above.
`build-next/references/auto-review.md` and `craft-spec/references/spec-guide.md` — these ALSO mention `AskUserQuestion` but are supporting reference docs, not the "9 shared SKILL.md bodies" the acceptance criterion names; leave them as-is for this task (a future task may extend the pattern to reference docs, but the backlog item's own acceptance text scopes to the 9 SKILL.md files specifically).
