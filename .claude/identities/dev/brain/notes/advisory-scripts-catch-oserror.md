Advisory-only scripts (preflight, status probes, HTTP read endpoints) must catch the OSError CLASS around every filesystem read and every state write. THIRD recurrence: history() caught only FileNotFoundError, so a chmod-000 transcript propagated PermissionError and dropped the whole HTTP response. The pattern to grep in review: any  on a read path is a smell — the broad-but-honest form is  + a warning field. Reads → enumerated warning/FAIL line; writes → degrade, still report.
