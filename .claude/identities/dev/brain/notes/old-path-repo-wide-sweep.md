When a value/pattern changes (config default, error-message shape, a buggy raycast target), grep the WHOLE repo for the old literal before writing tests — the second bug instance (dblclick guard's copy of the same line) only surfaced via a deliberate sweep. Pin with a check_absent on the OLD pattern (catches all instances at once), not just a check for the new one.
